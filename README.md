Life's a bit chaotic during this Ludum Dare, but I still managed to put something together! :D

My entry is a simple puzzle game where you control two cubes in connected worlds. The game is a bit short, unfortunately. The purple tiles at the end of the second stage were meant to be their own level but I didn't have time to complete it. :(

-- Controls --

A,D or Arrow Keys -- Move

Space -- Transfer
